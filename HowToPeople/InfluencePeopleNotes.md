# _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ - Notes 📝

This is a collection of quotes and notes from a great book by **Dale Carnegie**.

## Fundamental techniques in handling people 🤝

#### Don’t criticise, condemn or complain

Criticism is futile because it puts people in a defensive and usually makes him strive to justify
himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of
importance and arouses resentment.

> “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation.” ~ Hans Selye

When dealing with people, let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are
dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and
vanity.

#### Give honest and sincere appreciation

Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the
desire to be great. If our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance,
civilisation would have been impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals. Be
hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.

> "I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or ant kindness that I can
> show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, got I shall not pass
> this way again."

> “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn for him.” ~ Emerson

#### Arouse in other people an eager want

> "If there is any secret in success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view
> and see things see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own." ~ Henry Ford

💡Think about what other people want. Nobody is interested in what you want. Your task is to speak
to other people in terms of what they want.

## Ways to make people like you ⭐️

1. Become genuinely interested in other people
   > “We are interested in other people when they are interested in us.” ~ Publilius Syrus
2. Smile
   > “A man without a smiling face should not open a shop”
3. Remember that person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important word in any
   language
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to speak about themselves
5. Talk in terms of other person’s interest
6. Make other people feel important - and to it sincerely

_“Oh yes, I did want something out from that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got
the feeling that I had done something for him without him being able to to do anything whatever in
return for me. This is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the incident is
past.”_

#### Always make the other person feel important.

## How to win people to your way of thinking 🤔

#### You cannot will an argument.

> “If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an
> empty victory because you will never get your oponent’s good will. ~ Benjamin Franklin

✨ **Magic phrase:** Well, now, look. I thought otherwise but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And
if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let's examine the facts.

#### Welcome the disagreement.

> “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary”.

If there is some point that you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your
attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to correct before you make a serious
mistake.

#### Distrust your first instinctive impression.

Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and
watch out for your first reaction.

#### Listen first and Control your temper.

Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Try to build bridges of
understanding.

#### Look for areas of agreement.

Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error. Apologise for your mistakes. Promise to think
over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. Thank your opponents sincerely for their
interest. Think of them as of people who are really trying to help you, and you may turn your
enemies into friends.

#### Moreover...

- Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.

- The only way to make the best out of argument is to avoid it.

- Show respect for other peoples’ opinions. Never say “You’re wrong”.

> “You cannot teach men anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.” ~ Galileo

Change your language and instead of words like “certainly”, “undoubtably”, use “I think”, “I
imagine”, “I conceive”, “I apprehend”. If you are wrong admit it quickly and empathetically

#### Begin in a friendly way

> “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gull.” ~ Abraham Lincoln

Take advantage of the secret of Socrates

- Get the other person say “yes, yes” immediately.
- _“He who treads softly goes far”_

#### Let the other person do a great deal of talking

Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves. Let the
other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So
ask them questions. **Let them tell you a few things**.

#### Let the other people feel that the idea is his or hers

Don't you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than ideas that are handed to
you on a silver platter? If so, isn't it bad judgment to try to round your opinions down the throats
of other people? Isn't it wiser to make suggestions – and let the other person think out the
conclusion?

#### Try to honestly see things from the other person’s point of view

Remember thet other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any
fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do
that. **Think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s
angle as well as your own.**

_"I would rather walk the sidewalk in from of a person’s office for two hours before an interview
then stepped into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what
that person - from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to answer."_

#### Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires

✨ **Magic phrase:** _"I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would
undoubtedly feel the same as you do."_

Remember: You deserve very little credit for being the way you are.

#### Appeal to nobler motives

#### Dramatize your ideas

#### Throw down a challenge

The desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to
people of spirit.

> “All men have fears, but the brave ones put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death,
> but always to victory.”
