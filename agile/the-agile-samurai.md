# The Agile Samurai - _Notes_

These are quotes and notes taken during reading _"The Agile Samurai"_ by Jonathan Rasmusson‎.

#### Deliver something of value every week

You want to break up big problems into smaller ones. Focus on the really important stuff and forget
everything else.

> Think big, act small.

Make sure that what you are delivering actually works.

Search feedback! Be ready to change direction when necessary.

**Extreme ownership!** You are responsible for everything and you are to be held accountable.

#### Three simple truths 📝🐛🦋⏳💸

1. It is impossible to gather all the requirements at the beginning of a project.
2. Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change.
3. There will always be more to do than time and money will allow.

### Agile team

The agile team should be a task unit. One team, not multiple silos.

- Co-located teams work better
- **Engage the customer**

Agile team is **self-organizing**. The team creates the plan, provides estimates and take ownership
of the project.

Do not worry about the roles. Agile teams are **cross-functional**.

🚨 **"If you think you have an issue with accountability, there is an easy fix—get your team to demo
their software."**

> Agile works best with folks who can act as an ensemble and check their egos at the door.

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and
> trust them to get the job done.

#### About The Agile Project Manager

> That is why a good PM will go to the ends of the earth to remove anything standing in the way of
> their team and success.

> A good agile PM doesn’t tell the team what to do, though—they don’t have to do that. They’ve
> helped create an environment such that the team is mostly independent and would continue to
> deliver fine in the PM’s absence. In fact, the hallmark of a good agile PM is the ability to
> disappear for a week and no one be the wiser.

### Ask questions ❓

Ask questions! Make sure that that you do not assume stuff.

> When you ass-u-me you're making an ass out of you and me!

> The assumption of consensus where none exists is what kills most projects.

#### Project's inception

Questions to ask at the inception of a project:

- How much experience does the team have?
- Have you ever done this before?
- How much resources do we have (time/money)?
- Who is the decisive person?

Prepare an
[**inception deck**](https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/).

### Seeing the Big Picture 🖼

> Before any project team can be really successful, they need to under- stand the why behind what
> they are building.

> It’s one thing to intellectually understand why we’re here. It’s something else entirely to know
> it. To really get inside your customers’ heads and really understand what they need, you must go
> and see for yourself.

### Making plans 📅

Estimates are not commitments. **Estimate should be a distribution.** You can use
[PERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique) for that.

Remember that high-level estimates are _guesses_. Be careful, because when such a guess gets turned
prematurely into a commitment the project can very quickly get into trouble.

> The simple fact is that accurate up-front estimates aren’t possible, and we need to stop
> pretending they are.

👨🏻‍💻 If you call yourself a professional, then never make promises you cannot keep.

When you do not know much about the stuff you have to estimate check out the _affinity estimating_.
Try to _t-shirt size_ your tasks. Measure them in relation to each other. Task could be a S, M, L,
XL, etc.

> Under no conditions can you let your customer think the plans you are presenting here are hard
> commitments. They are not. They are simply unvalidated high-level guesses that can be vetted only
> by building something, measuring how long that takes, and feeding that information back into the
> plan.

Remember that when it comes to Time, Budget, Scope and Quality, we are talking about trade-offs.
Usually we cannot change Time and Budget and a **professional won't agree on trade-offs on
quality!** Thus, we are left with Scope. If something has to give, let it be the scope.

### User stories

Lots of time and energy is spent debating what was written, instead of doing what needs to be done.
Customers seldom get what they want. Teams seldom build what is needed.

🚨 **The problem with documentation is not its volume. It is all about communication.**

🗞 An extreme example of when grammar in the documentation really mattered and
[cost a company a million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/business/worldbusiness/25comma.html).

In the end we want something that enables conversation about a requirement, captures the essence of
what the customer wants, and is small enough that it can be planned, **yet descriptive enough to
remind us what we are talking about**.

**User stories have to be meaningful to business.** For that reason we want to write them in simple,
understandable terms. Be carefully about using a very technical language.

**User story should:**

- Go from end to end
- Be Independent - Things change. If user stories depend on each other, making trade-offs becomes
  hard.
- Be testable
- Be small and estimable

```
INVEST = “Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small, Testable.”
```

🚨 **Look for metics! Whe want to be able to measure stuff.** If you hear _"I want my website fast"_
figure out what _fast_ actually means! Change _"the website should be fast"_ into _"the website
should load in less than 2 seconds"_.

## Dealing with reality

Do not make static plans. Being agile is about... being agile. Make constant shifts in direction
based on feedback. An agile team should be a tomahawk cruise missile, not an arrow shot from a
longbow. 😄

Measure _team's velocity_ and check how fast are you burning through the _master story list_.

> When we create plans based on our team’s velocity, we are making a commitment as a team. We’re
> saying, “We as a team feel we do deliver this much value, each and every iteration.” This is very
> different from measuring individual productivity— which leads to the dark side of project
> management. If you want more bugs, more rework, more miscommunication, less collaboration, less
> skill, and less knowledge sharing, then by all means, promote, highlight, and reward individual
> developer productivity. Just understand that by doing so, you are killing the very spirit and
> behavior we want to foster and promote on our projects: sharing ideas, helping each other out, and
> watching for things that fall through the cracks.

```
Team's velocity = story points completed / iteration
```

**Be flexible about the scope.** This is how agile projects maintain the integrity of their plans.
Welcome changing requirements (they will come whether you like it or not).

**Prioritize things to be done.**

👉 Customer cannot add something to the list and not expect something of equal size to come off.
That's wishful thinking, and there is no place for that in agile planning. Make this clear and well
understood.

> 80% of a system’s value often comes from a mere 20% of its features.

> Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done.

### When there are problems...

✨ Sit down with your customer and try to figure out a way to help him. Helping your client in their
time of need will be a long way to building a relationship. You'll be seen as a trusted advisor.
Give your customer options.

Do not get forced into committing to something you cannot deliver. That won't help anyone. The
collaboration happens both ways. **Be honest and tell what it is going to take.**

## Make it happen ✅

#### Just in time analysis 🤔

You will not have time to write everything down. You have to find a way of doing analysis that is
**accurate** but at the same time **light**. Make sure that it gives you what you need.

#### Rock solid development 💎

You'll not have time to go back to buggy code over and over again. It has to be well-designed,
well-tested, well-integrated.

🔑 Key principal for agile developers: **Collective Code Ownership**. This is just an extension of
the _extreme ownership_ attitude. Code belongs to the team. Every person is responsible on it.

#### Test early, Test often

You can’t afford to wait until the end of the project to see whether everything works. You are going
to have to maintain the health and integrity of the system from day one of the project.

One could think of the agile process as of a feedback loop.

```
                   +--------------------+
                   |                    |
                   |  Analysis & Design |            Working
Stories +-----+--->+  Development       +----+-----> Software
              ^    |  Testing           |    |
              |    |  Everything else   |    |
              |    |                    |    |
              |    |                    |    |
              |    +--------------------+    |
              |                              |
              |                              |
              +------------------------------+
                        Feedback
```

(getting flashbacks from your control theory classes? 😅)

## A few notes about processes and agile attitude

Agile is not a set of principals carved in stone. It a philosophy of adaptation. Not everything that
is _trendy_ in the industry must necessarily work in your project.

> It’s a journey, not a destination. You never really get there.

Do not make it a purpose of its own. Avoid _Holy Scrum_!

Understand differences between different flavors of agile (scrum, kanban, XP,... ). E.g. that Kanban
should optimise _flow_ and that it does not require iterations in the same way scrum does.

Which is best? It depends... 😉

Just remember that:

> Two constants on any agile project are setting expectations and getting feedback.

#### Retrospectives

First of all, make sure people feel safe and are open to speak their mind.

Make retrospectives quick. Ask:

- _What are we doing well?_
- _What do we need to improve?_

#### What to say on a daily standup

❌ Do not do this: _What I did yesterday?_, _What I'm going to do today?_, _What is slowing me
down?_

👌 Instead try to say: _What have I done to change the world today?_, _How are you going to make the
best of yourself today?_, _How are you going to go through all obstacles?_

This will improve the dynamics. **Instead of just giving a status report, you are declaring your
intent in front on the team.** From that point, you can either follow through and deliver, or not.
It's up to you! (Imagine this last sentence said with Jocko Willing's voice 😉)

### Own it 💪

It is all about choice. No one can stop you from delivering high-quality software. No one can stop
you from being honest and responsible. In other words, it is your choice if you want to be a
professional.

Beware! Not everyone wants to be a professional.

📚 Go ahead and read the first chapter of the _Clean Coder_ and see what does it mean to be a
professional programmer.

👉 Remember - do not evangelize. Do not tell others what to do. **Lead by example.**
