# Kolb's Learning Cycle / Cykl Kolba

[David A. Kolb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Kolb) co-created the _Experimental Learning
Model_. The idea is that people can transform experience to knowledge and then be able to change
their behavior.

If you're creating trainings programmes _Kolb's cycle_ should be one of your primary tools.

👉 The core assumption here is that, when teaching, we expect to permanently change someone's
behavior, someone's information that he or she uses to analyse the surrounding word, what tools that
person can use, and how that person will be able to deal with tasks and challenges.

In other words, we expect practical effects from our teaching efforts.

💡 Kolb's cycle isn't meant to be an artificial model but rather a description of our learning
process.

## 4 steps

Kolb's cycle consists of 4 steps.

_In order to learn most effectively you must follow the 4 steps._

As a teacher you don't have to go through these steps starting from step 1. You can enter the model
from any stage.

### Concrete Experience (Konkretne doświadczenie)

_You must do it yourself for learning to occur._

🧠 Something happens; You're taking a part in something; Some data is being registered by your
senses.

As a teacher you should engage training's participants in some exercise. It can be something as
simple as encouraging participants to think about a certain problem or reflect on a situation that
happened in their past.

👉 **Engagement in experience** - you cannot learn if you're not participating in an "experience".

### Reflective Observation (Refleksja)

_Taking a step back from doing and review and reflect on the big picture on what you've just done._

🧠 You notice and process the data that has been registered by your senses.

As the participants about their observations and thoughts. _How was it? What's your impression? What
do you think about it? How did you feel? What did you like and dislike about it?_

Try to look at your experiences from a more distant perspective so that you can see a greater
picture. As a teacher you should create an environment that allows participants to look at their
experiences from a different side. They should reflect on their experience and feeling from a point
of a 3rd person.

### Abstract Conceptualization (Konceptualizacja)

_Fit what you've learned into what you already know._

🧠 You try to connect my experiences into a cohesive whole. You try to draw conclusions and theories
based on what you've experienced. _What's the conclusions? What can I learn from this?_

_How can we put together all of our observations and sum them up? What's the conclusion? How do you
understand it?_

Based on observations that we gathered in the previous step, we want to group them and create
something like a theory. It's important that such "theories" are based on concrete experiences
shared by training participants.

### Active experimentation (Stosowanie)

_How will you put what you've learned into practice?_

🧠 _What do I do now with this? How can I use it?_

Ask how are they going to apply what they learned in their daily work. _How can we use this in
practice? How can we translate it to actions? Based on what we discussed, what can be changed?_

Keep in mind that this step can be done only after the participants have a grasp of the ideas that
were supposed to be explained in previous steps.

## Kolb's learning styles

Kolb observed that different people prefer different learning styles.

There are various factors that influence parson's preferred style. Kolb's model divides the problem
of learning style preference into two dimensions.

- **Feeling vs Thinking** (Perception continuum)
- **Doing vs Watching** (Processing continuum)

Knowing a person's preferred style can help you adjust your learning method.

### Diverging 🫀 👀

Can see things from different perspective. They'd rather watch than do. They like to collect
information and use it to solve problems. They take feedback well (open-minded). They are interested
in different cultures and different people. They work well in groups. They are interested in people
and can be emotional. They are great in situations that require idea-generation like brainstorming.

### Assimilating 🤔 👀

They enjoy ideas, concepts, and theories. They are less interested in people. They are logical and
like solving problems. They are more interested in theory rather than practical applications. They
prefer to read or listen to a lecture. **They require good explanation of a theory** rather than
practical demonstration.

### Converging 🤔 ✍️

They are problems solvers that look for solutions to practical issues. They are less interested in
people. They'd rather work on technical tasks. **They like to experiment with new ideas and work
with practical applications.** They enjoy the "doing" aspect. They like to get their hands dirty
using the new knowledge.

### Accommodating 🫀 ✍️

"Learning through doing". They rely on logical analysis that has been done by others. They rely on
their gut feeling rather than logic. They prefer experimental approach.

Supposedly this learning style is widespread in general population.
